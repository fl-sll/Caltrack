            <div class="content"> <p>Clean eating is traditionally defined as eating simple, whole foods without any artificial ingredients. This typically involves the elimination of most processed foods, trans fats, heavy saturated fats, added sugar and refined grains. And some choose to take clean eating a notch further by also eliminating gluten, dairy, and soy as well. </p> </div>

                <p> A low-carb diet limits carbohydrates such as those found in grains, starchy vegetables and fruit and emphasizes foods high in protein and fat. Many types of low-carb diets exist. Each diet has varying restrictions on the types and amounts of carbohydrates you can eat.</p>
                <p> A low-carb diet is generally used for weight loss. Some low-carb diets may have health benefits beyond weight loss, such as reducing your risk of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. </p>
